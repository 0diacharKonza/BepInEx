Shikwa Jawab e Shikwa is divided into two parts: Shikwa (The Complaint) and Jawab e Shikwa (The Answer to the Complaint). The first part was written in 1909 and the second part in 1913. Both parts were published in Iqbal's book Bang-e-Dara (The Call of the Marching Bell) in 1924.
  
In Shikwa, the Muslim speaker laments the decline and humiliation of the Muslim world. He questions why Allah has forsaken his faithful servants who have sacrificed and suffered for his cause. He accuses Allah of being indifferent and unjust to the Muslims, who are oppressed and persecuted by their enemies. He also expresses his dissatisfaction with the state of affairs in the Muslim society, which has become corrupt and divided.
  
In Jawab e Shikwa, Allah responds to the Muslim speaker's grievances. He reminds him of his blessings and favors upon the Muslims, who were once the leaders and rulers of the world. He also rebukes him for his ingratitude and arrogance, and warns him of the consequences of his disobedience and negligence. He advises him to reform himself and his community, and to strive for excellence and virtue. He also assures him of his mercy and support, and promises him a glorious future if he follows his guidance.
