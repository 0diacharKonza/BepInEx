If you want to become a successful manager, you need to master some skills and strategies that will help you achieve your goals. Here are some tips and tricks that will make your life easier in Championship Manager 2008:

- Rotate your squad for league and cup football. Don't use the same players for every match, as they will get tired and lose their form. Instead, try to have two sets of players for different competitions, and switch them according to their fitness and morale. This way, you will avoid injuries and keep your players happy and motivated.
- Select the 4-1-3-2 formation. This is one of the most effective formations in Championship Manager 2008, as it provides balance and flexibility. You can have a solid defense with four defenders and a defensive midfielder, a creative midfield with three attacking midfielders, and a lethal attack with two strikers. You can also adjust the roles and duties of your players according to their strengths and weaknesses.
- Add Tsikalgo to your team. Tsikalgo is a Belarusian striker who plays for Dinamo Minsk. He is one of the best players in Championship Manager 2008, as he has amazing attributes and skills. He is fast, strong, agile, skillful, and has a great finishing ability. He can score goals from anywhere on the pitch, and he is also good at heading and free kicks. You can sign him for a bargain price of around 2 million pounds.
- Make the most of scouts. Scouts are essential in Championship Manager 2008, as they can help you find hidden gems and talented youngsters. You can assign scouts to different regions and countries, and they will report back to you with their findings. You can also ask them to scout specific players or teams that you are interested in. Scouts can also give you useful information about your opponents' tactics and players before a match.
- Don't select players who are less than 80% match fit. Match fitness is an important factor in Championship Manager 2008, as it affects the performance and stamina of your players. If you select players who are not fully fit, they will get tired quickly and make more mistakes. They will also be more prone to injuries and suspensions. Therefore, you should always check the match fitness of your players before selecting them, and avoid using players who are less than 80% match fit.
- Utilize the compare player option. This is a handy feature in Championship Manager 2008 that allows you to compare two players side by side. You can see their attributes, skills, stats, contracts, histories, and personalities. This can help you decide which player to sign, sell, or select for a match. You can also compare your own players with your rivals' players to see how they stack up against each other.
