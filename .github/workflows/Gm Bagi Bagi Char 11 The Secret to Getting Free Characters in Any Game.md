## What is gm bagi bagi char 11?
 
Gm bagi bagi char 11 is a phrase that originated from Indonesian players of Crossfire and Lost Saga, two popular online shooting games. Crossfire is a game where players compete in various modes such as team deathmatch, search and destroy, and zombie mode. Lost Saga is a game where players can choose from over 100 different characters with unique skills and abilities, and fight in various modes such as hero mode, team deathmatch, and boss raid.
 
Both games have a system where players can buy or earn characters with different levels of rarity and power. Some characters are more desirable than others, and some are very hard to get. For example, in Crossfire, character 11 is a female character named Fox who has a special ability to see through walls. In Lost Saga, character 11 is a male character named Jin Kisaragi who has a special ability to use lightning attacks.
 
According to the rumor, some GMs are willing to give away these characters for free to players who ask for them politely and discreetly. The rumor claims that the GMs do this as a way of rewarding loyal and active players, or as a way of promoting the games. However, the rumor also warns that the GMs are very secretive about this, and that players should not talk about it publicly or ask for it too often.
 
## Where did gm bagi bagi char 11 come from?
 
It is not clear when or how gm bagi bagi char 11 started, but it seems to have been around for several years. Some possible sources of the rumor are:
 
- Social media posts: Some players have posted screenshots or videos of themselves receiving free characters from GMs on platforms like Facebook[^4^] [^5^], YouTube, or SoundCloud[^1^] [^2^] [^3^]. These posts may have inspired other players to try their luck or spread the word.
- Fake GMs: Some scammers have pretended to be GMs and offered free characters to players in exchange for their account information or money. These scammers may have created fake accounts or hacked into real ones, and used them to contact unsuspecting players via chat or email. These scammers may have also used bots or hacked websites to generate fake comments or reviews that support their claims.
- Real GMs: It is possible that some GMs have actually given away free characters to some players for various reasons. However, this is very unlikely and unconfirmed, as it would violate the terms of service of the games and create an unfair advantage for some players over others. It would also risk damaging the reputation and revenue of the game developers and publishers.

## Is gm bagi bagi char 11 real or not?
 
The short answer is: no. Gm bagi bagi char 11 is not real, and there is no evidence that any GM has ever given away free characters to any player in Crossfire or Lost Saga. The rumor is most likely a hoax or a scam that aims to deceive or exploit gullible players.
 
The long answer is: maybe. There is a very slim chance that some GMs have secretly given away free characters to some players for personal reasons or as part of an unofficial promotion. However, this is extremely rare and unlikely, and there is no reliable way to verify or replicate it. Therefore, it is safer and wiser to assume that gm bagi bagi char 11 is not real, and to avoid falling for it.
