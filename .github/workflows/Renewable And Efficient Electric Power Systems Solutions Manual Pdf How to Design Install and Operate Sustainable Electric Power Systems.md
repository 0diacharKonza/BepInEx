The book is divided into nine chapters, each focusing on a different aspect of renewable and efficient electric power systems. The first chapter introduces the basic electric and magnetic circuits, while the second chapter explains the fundamentals of electric power. The third chapter gives an overview of the electric power industry, including its history, structure, regulation, and environmental impacts. The fourth chapter discusses the concept of distributed generation, its benefits, challenges, and applications. The fifth chapter analyzes the economics of distributed resources, such as net metering, feed-in tariffs, and demand response. The sixth chapter explores the wind power systems, including their design, operation, integration, and impacts. The seventh chapter describes the solar resource, its measurement, estimation, and variability. The eighth chapter covers the photovoltaic materials and electrical characteristics, such as cell types, efficiency, degradation, and modeling. The ninth chapter presents the photovoltaic systems, including their components, configurations, sizing, installation, performance, and maintenance.
 
The book also includes six appendices that provide useful conversion factors, sun-path diagrams, hourly and monthly clear-sky insolation tables, solar insolation tables by city, maps of solar insolation, and an index. The book is accompanied by a solutions manual that contains detailed solutions to selected problems from each chapter. The solutions manual is available online from Chegg.com[^2^] or Wiley Online Books[^1^]. The book is suitable for undergraduate and graduate students in electrical engineering, civil engineering, environmental engineering, mechanical engineering, and related fields. It is also a valuable reference for professionals and researchers in the electric power industry, renewable energy industry, and energy policy sector.

The book also provides a comprehensive overview of the benefits of renewable and efficient electric power systems for the economy, environment, national security, and human health. Some of the benefits are[^1^] [^3^] [^4^]:
 
- Enhanced reliability, security, and resilience of the nationâs power grid: Renewable and efficient electric power systems can help reduce the dependence on fossil fuels, diversify the energy mix, balance the supply and demand, and mitigate the impacts of natural disasters, cyberattacks, and climate change on the electricity system.
- Job creation throughout renewable energy industries: Renewable and efficient electric power systems can stimulate economic growth and employment opportunities in various sectors, such as manufacturing, installation, operation, maintenance, research, and development of renewable energy technologies and infrastructure.
- Reduced carbon emissions and air pollution from energy production: Renewable and efficient electric power systems can help lower greenhouse gas emissions and other harmful pollutants from fossil fuel combustion, such as particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, mercury, and lead. These pollutants can cause serious health problems, such as asthma, respiratory infections, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and premature death.
- Increased U.S. energy independence: Renewable and efficient electric power systems can help reduce the reliance on imported oil and gas, which can expose the country to geopolitical risks, price fluctuations, supply disruptions, and trade deficits.
- Expanded clean energy access for non-grid-connected or remote, coastal, or islanded communities: Renewable and efficient electric power systems can provide affordable, reliable, and sustainable electricity to communities that are not connected to the grid or face high electricity costs due to their location. These communities can benefit from improved living standards, education, health care, and economic development.

The book also discusses the challenges and barriers that need to be overcome to achieve a widespread adoption of renewable and efficient electric power systems. Some of the challenges are technical, such as integrating variable renewable energy sources into the grid, ensuring adequate transmission and distribution capacity, improving energy storage and demand response technologies, and enhancing system flexibility and stability. Some of the challenges are economic, such as reducing the costs of renewable energy technologies and infrastructure, increasing their competitiveness with fossil fuels, providing adequate incentives and financing mechanisms for renewable energy projects, and addressing market failures and externalities. Some of the challenges are social and political, such as increasing public awareness and acceptance of renewable energy sources, addressing environmental and social impacts of renewable energy development, ensuring equitable access and distribution of benefits among different stakeholders, and harmonizing policies and regulations at different levels of governance.
