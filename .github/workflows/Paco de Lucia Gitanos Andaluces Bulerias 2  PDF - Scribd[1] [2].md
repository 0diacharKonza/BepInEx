Paco de Lucia was born in 1947 in Algeciras, a city in the province of Cadiz, Andalusia. He came from a musical family, as his father and two brothers were also flamenco guitarists. He started playing the guitar at a very young age, and soon developed his own style and technique. He was influenced by many flamenco masters, such as NiÃ±o Ricardo, Sabicas, and Mario Escudero, but also by other genres of music, such as classical, jazz, and Latin American.
 
He became famous in the 1960s, when he formed a duo with the singer CamarÃ³n de la Isla. Together, they revolutionized flamenco music, by introducing new elements and innovations. They recorded several albums that are considered classics of flamenco history, such as La leyenda del tiempo, Como el agua, and Soy gitano. Paco de Lucia also collaborated with other artists, such as John McLaughlin, Al Di Meola, Chick Corea, and Bryan Adams.
 
He composed many original pieces for the guitar, such as Entre dos aguas, Rio Ancho, Mediterranean Sundance, and Gitanos Andaluces. He also adapted some traditional flamenco forms, such as soleares, alegrÃ­as, tarantas, and bulerÃ­as. He created his own group of musicians, which included his brothers RamÃ³n de Algeciras and Pepe de LucÃ­a, as well as Jorge Pardo, Rubem Dantas, Carles Benavent, and Manolo Soler. He performed in many prestigious venues and festivals around the world, and received numerous awards and honors for his work.
 
Paco de Lucia died in 2014 in Mexico, at the age of 66. He left behind a legacy of music that has influenced generations of guitarists and flamenco lovers. He is widely recognized as one of the most important and influential musicians of the 20th century.
