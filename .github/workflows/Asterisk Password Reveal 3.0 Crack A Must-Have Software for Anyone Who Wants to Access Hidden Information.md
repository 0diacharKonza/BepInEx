Have you ever forgotten the password that you entered in a website or an application? If so, you might have noticed that most of them do not display the real password in the login box, but instead show asterisks (\*\*\*\*) for security reasons. This can be frustrating if you need to know the actual password, especially if you do not have a password manager or a backup.
