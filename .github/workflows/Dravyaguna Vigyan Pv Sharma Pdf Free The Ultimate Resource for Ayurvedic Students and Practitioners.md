In this article, we will discuss some of the important concepts and terms related to Dravyaguna Vigyan, such as:
 
## Dravya
 
Dravya means substance or matter. It is the basic unit of creation and the source of all qualities and actions. According to Ayurveda, there are two types of dravyas: bhautika (physical) and abhautika (non-physical). Bhautika dravyas are derived from the five elements (panchamahabhutas): earth (prithvi), water (jala), fire (agni), air (vayu) and ether (akasha). Abhautika dravyas are the subtle entities that transcend the physical realm, such as mind (manas), intellect (buddhi), ego (ahamkara) and soul (atma).
 
## Guna
 
Guna means quality or attribute. It is the inherent property of a dravya that determines its nature, behavior and effect. According to Ayurveda, there are three types of gunas: sattva (purity), rajas (activity) and tamas (inertia). These gunas are also known as trigunas or the three modes of nature. They influence the mental, emotional and spiritual aspects of a person. Sattva guna is conducive to health, happiness and wisdom. Rajas guna is responsible for movement, passion and ambition. Tamas guna causes dullness, ignorance and attachment.
 
## Rasa
 
Rasa means taste or flavor. It is the first impression of a dravya on the tongue. According to Ayurveda, there are six types of rasas: madhura (sweet), amla (sour), lavana (salty), katu (pungent), tikta (bitter) and kashaya (astringent). These rasas are also known as shadrasas or the six tastes. They influence the digestion, metabolism and balance of the three doshas (vata, pitta and kapha) in the body. Madhura rasa is nourishing, cooling and calming. Amla rasa is stimulating, cleansing and appetizing. Lavana rasa is moistening, softening and laxative. Katu rasa is heating, drying and penetrating. Tikta rasa is detoxifying, anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial. Kashaya rasa is contracting, stabilizing and healing.
