## How to Crack FileOpen Plugin for Adobe?
 
There are several methods to crack FileOpen plugin for Adobe and access encrypted PDFs, depending on the type and level of encryption used by the publisher. Here are some of the most common ones:
  
### Method 1: Export to Word via Adobe Acrobat DC
 
Depending on the settings, some of the FileOpen DRM documents can be exported to Word via Adobe Acrobat DC "Export file" without any issues[^2^]. If you wish to remove the watermarking, it's then a simply a word search-and-replace.
 
To do this, you need to have Adobe Acrobat DC installed on your device, along with the FileOpen plugin. Then follow these steps:
 
1. Open the encrypted PDF file with Adobe Acrobat DC.
2. Go to File > Export To > Microsoft Word > Word Document.
3. Choose a location and name for the exported file and click Save.
4. Open the Word file and edit or remove any unwanted elements.
5. Save the Word file as a PDF file if you want.

### Method 2: Use Python Script for Windows
 
There used to be a Python script for Windows that would remove FileOpen DRM from PDF files[^2^]. However, it dates from 2010 and may not work with newer versions of FileOpen or Adobe. An upgrade to FileOpen about three years ago broke it[^2^]. However, some users report that they managed to make it work with some tweaks[^2^].
 
To use this method, you need to have Python 2 installed on your device, along with some libraries like PyCrypto and PyWin32. You also need to download the ineptpdf script from here: https://tetrachroma.wordpress.com/2010/03/24/ineptpdf-8-4-51/. Then follow these steps:

1. Run ineptpdf\_8.4.51.pyw by double-clicking on it.
2. Select the encrypted PDF file you want to decrypt and click Open.
3. Select a location and name for the decrypted file and click Save.
4. Wait for the script to finish running and check if the decrypted file is accessible.
