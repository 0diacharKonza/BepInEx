Fracture analysis is a technique to study the behavior of materials under crack initiation and propagation. It is useful for evaluating the strength and durability of structures and components. In this article, we will show you how to perform fracture analysis using pre-meshed crack with Ansys 14, a powerful software for finite element analysis (FEA).

Pre-meshed crack is a method to model a crack in a solid body using existing mesh elements, without modifying the geometry. It is convenient for cases where the crack shape and location are known in advance, or where the crack does not change significantly during the analysis. Pre-meshed crack can also reduce the meshing time and complexity compared to other methods such as submodeling or extended finite element method (XFEM).

1. Create a coordinate system at the crack tip.
2. Create a nodal named selection at the crack front.
3. Define the crack parameters such as mode, length, orientation and opening.
4. Apply boundary conditions and loads to the model.
5. Solve the model and post-process the results.

We will illustrate these steps using an example of a plate with a center crack under tension. The geometry and mesh of the plate are shown below:
 ![Plate geometry and mesh](plate.png) 
The plate has dimensions of 200 mm x 100 mm x 10 mm, and is made of steel with Young's modulus of 200 GPa and Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The crack has a length of 20 mm and is oriented along the x-axis. The plate is fixed at the left edge and subjected to a uniform tensile stress of 100 MPa at the right edge.
 
## Step 1: Create a coordinate system at the crack tip
 
To define the crack parameters, we need to create a local coordinate system at the crack tip. This can be done by using the Coordinate Systems feature in Ansys Workbench. We can select the origin of the coordinate system as the node at the crack tip, and align the x-axis with the crack direction. The y-axis and z-axis can be arbitrary, as long as they are orthogonal to each other and to the x-axis. The coordinate system can be named as "CrackTip" for convenience.
 
## Step 2: Create a nodal named selection at the crack front
 
To apply the crack opening displacement (COD) to the model, we need to create a nodal named selection at the crack front. This can be done by using the Named Selection feature in Ansys Workbench. We can select all the nodes along the crack front by using a box selection or a cylindrical selection. The named selection can be named as "CrackFront" for convenience.
 
## Step 3: Define the crack parameters
 
To define the crack parameters, we need to use the Fracture feature in Ansys Mechanical. We can drag and drop a Fracture object from the Toolbox onto the Model tree. Then, we can specify the following parameters:

- Crack Type: Pre-Meshed Crack
- Coordinate System: CrackTip
- Crack Front: CrackFront
- Mode: Mode I (opening mode)
- Length: 20 mm
- Orientation Angle: 0 deg (parallel to x-axis)
- Opening: User Defined
- COD: 0.1 mm (constant along the crack front)

The Fracture object can be named as "Crack" for convenience.
 
## Step 4: Apply boundary conditions and loads to the model
 
To apply boundary conditions and loads to the model, we need to use the Supports and Loads features in Ansys Mechanical. We can apply a Fixed Support to all nodes at the left edge of the plate, and a Remote Force to all nodes at the right edge
