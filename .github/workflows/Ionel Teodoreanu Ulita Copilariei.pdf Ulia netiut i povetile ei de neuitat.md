UliÅ£a CopilÄriei is a collection of short stories that narrate the childhood memories of the author, who grew up in a small town in Moldavia, near the border with Bessarabia. The stories are told from the perspective of the narrator's older brother, who recalls with nostalgia and humor the adventures and mischiefs of his younger brother, nicknamed ScÃ¢ncea-Voievod (Squeak-Voivode).
 
The stories are full of charm and warmth, as they portray the simple joys and sorrows of childhood, the bond between siblings and friends, the fascination with nature and animals, the discovery of love and literature, and the contrast between the urban and rural worlds. The stories also reflect the historical and cultural context of Romania at the turn of the century, when it was undergoing modernization and facing political and social challenges.
 
The title of the book refers to the humble and quiet street where the narrator's family lived, which was a source of inspiration and freedom for the children. The street was also a symbol of their identity and belonging, as they felt alienated from the other streets of the town, which were more crowded and noisy. The street was their playground, their refuge, their home.
