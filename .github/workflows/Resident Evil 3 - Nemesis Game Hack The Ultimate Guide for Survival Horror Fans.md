## How to Play Resident Evil 3 - Nemesis Like a Pro
 
Besides hacking your game, you might also want to learn some tips and tricks to play Resident Evil 3 - Nemesis like a pro. Here are some of them:

- Conserve your ammo by avoiding unnecessary fights, using the knife when possible, and aiming for the head or limbs of zombies. You can also use explosive barrels, generators, or environmental hazards to deal damage to enemies.
- Break every wooden crate you see with yellow paper on them. They contain useful items such as ammo, herbs, or gunpowder. You can also find hidden items by checking lockers, drawers, shelves, or corpses.
- Upgrade your weapons by finding parts and attachments throughout the game. For example, you can find a dot sight for your pistol in a safe near the donut shop. The combination is 9 left, 3 right, 7 left[^2^]. Upgraded weapons have better accuracy, damage, capacity, or fire rate.
- Use different types of ammo for different situations. For example, flame rounds are effective against Nemesis and other bio-weapons, while acid rounds are good for destroying armored enemies. You can also craft ammo by combining gunpowder with different chemicals.
- Learn how to dodge and counterattack by pressing R1/right bumper at the right moment. This will trigger a slow-motion effect that allows you to aim for a critical hit. Dodging is essential for avoiding damage and creating distance from enemies.
- Use herbs and first aid sprays to heal yourself when injured. You can also combine herbs to create more potent mixtures. For example, combining a green herb and a red herb will fully restore your health, while combining a green herb and a blue herb will cure poison.
- Explore the game world and find hidden secrets and collectibles. You can find files that reveal more about the story and lore of Resident Evil 3 - Nemesis, as well as bonus items such as costumes, weapons, or modes that can be unlocked after beating the game.

## How to Beat Nemesis in Boss Fights
 
Nemesis is the main antagonist of Resident Evil 3 - Nemesis and he will chase you throughout the game. He is very fast, strong, and resilient, and he can use various weapons and attacks to kill you. Here are some tips on how to beat him in boss fights:
