CATIA V5R20 is a popular software for 3D modeling and design, developed by Dassault Systemes. It offers various features and configurations for different industries and applications. However, like any software, it may have some bugs or issues that need to be fixed. That's why Dassault Systemes releases service packs on a regular basis, which contain software fixes and enhancements for CATIA V5R20.
 
In this article, we will show you how to install a service pack for code level B20 of CATIA V5R20, which is one of the latest versions of the software. A service pack can only be installed after installing a major release, and it supersedes the previous service packs. Installing a service pack also involves committing or rolling back a service pack, which means you can choose to keep or discard the changes made by the service pack.

Before you start, make sure you have the following requirements:
 
- A Windows computer with administrator privileges
- A service pack CD-ROM or an ISO file downloaded from Dassault Systemes website
- A CATIA V5R20 GA (general availability) release installed in your computer

Now, follow these steps to install a service pack for code level B20 of CATIA V5R20:

1. Insert the service pack CD-ROM into your drive or mount the ISO file using a virtual drive software. The installation should start automatically. If not, open the CD-ROM or ISO file and run setup.exe.
2. The Welcome dialog box will appear. Click Next to continue.
3. If any Dassault Systemes processes are still running, preventing correct service pack setup, the setup program will detect them and prompt you to terminate them. Click Yes to do so and continue.
4. The Dassault Systemes Service Pack dialog box will appear. Here you can choose to commit the service pack during the installation or later. Committing the service pack means you will save disk space by deleting the previous versions of the components that are updated by the service pack. If you do not commit the service pack during the installation, you can do it later using the Commit utility. However, if you want to roll back the service pack later, you should not commit it during the installation. Rolling back the service pack means you will restore the previous versions of the components that are updated by the service pack. You can do this using the Rollback utility.
5. Click Next to continue. The Recap dialog box will appear, showing you a summary of your choices and actions.
6. Click Install to start installing the service pack. The Setup complete dialog box will appear when the installation is finished.
7. Click Finish to exit the setup program.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed a service pack for code level B20 of CATIA V5R20. You can now enjoy the improved performance and functionality of your software.
