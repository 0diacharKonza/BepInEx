## How to Use Fusion 360 2019 8.36 (x86x64) Effectively and Efficiently
 
To use Fusion 360 2019 8.36 (x86x64) effectively and efficiently, you need to familiarize yourself with the user interface and the basic functions of the software. Here are some tips and tricks that can help you:

- Use the navigation tools to zoom, pan, orbit, and rotate your view of the model. You can also use keyboard shortcuts or mouse gestures for faster navigation.
- Use the browser panel to access your project files, data, and settings. You can also use it to switch between different workspaces, such as design, simulation, render, or manufacture.
- Use the toolbar to access the most common commands and tools for each workspace. You can also customize the toolbar by adding or removing buttons or groups.
- Use the timeline to track and edit your design history. You can also use it to create parameters, constraints, dimensions, and expressions for your model.
- Use the sketch environment to create 2D shapes and curves that can be used as the basis for your 3D model. You can also use sketch constraints and dimensions to control the geometry and size of your sketch.
- Use the modeling environment to create 3D solid or surface bodies from your sketches or other sources. You can also use modeling tools such as extrude, revolve, sweep, loft, fillet, chamfer, shell, split, combine, etc. to modify your model.
- Use the sculpt environment to create organic shapes using T-splines or NURBS surfaces. You can also use sculpt tools such as edit form, insert edge, bridge, crease, etc. to manipulate your surface.
- Use the patch environment to create surface patches that can be used to repair or fill gaps in your model. You can also use patch tools such as trim, extend, stitch, offset, etc. to modify your surface.
- Use the render environment to apply materials, textures, lighting, and shadows to your model and render it in high quality. You can also use render settings such as exposure, depth of field, background image, etc. to adjust your render.
- Use the simulation environment to test your model with various simulation methods such as static stress, modal frequencies, thermal, structural buckling etc. You can also use simulation settings such as materials properties boundary conditions load cases results etc. to analyze your simulation.
- Use the manufacture environment to generate toolpaths and G-code for CNC machining 3D printing or laser cutting. You can also use manufacture settings such as setup stock tool library operation type feeds speeds etc. to optimize your manufacture.
