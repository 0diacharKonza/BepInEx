He teaches how we can connect with our soul and listen to its guidance and intuition.

He defines love as a state of consciousness that transcends the ego and the senses, and that unites us with ourselves, with others, and with the divine. He explores the different types and levels of love, such as self-love, romantic love, universal love, and spiritual love. He also advises how we can cultivate and express love in our daily lives.
