## What are Facebook chat bubbles?
 
Facebook chat bubbles are small circles that appear on the edge of your screen when you receive a message on Messenger. They show the profile picture of the sender and a snippet of their message. You can tap on them to open a chat window without leaving the app you're currently using. You can also drag them around the screen or dismiss them by swiping them down.
