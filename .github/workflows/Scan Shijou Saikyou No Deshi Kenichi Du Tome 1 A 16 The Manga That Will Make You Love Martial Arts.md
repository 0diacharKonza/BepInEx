## The Plot
 
The story begins with Kenichi Shirahama, a weak and nerdy boy who loves reading books but has no friends or self-esteem. He is constantly bullied and harassed by his classmates, especially by members of the karate club. His life changes when he meets Miu Furinji, a beautiful and mysterious transfer student who saves him from a group of thugs. Miu invites Kenichi to her home, which turns out to be the Ryozanpaku dojo, where she lives with her grandfather Hayato Furinji and five other martial arts masters: Akisame Koetsuji (jujutsu), Shio Sakaki (karate), Apachai Hopachai (muay thai), Kensei Ma (kung fu), and Shigure Kosaka (weapons).
 
Kenichi is awed by their skills and personalities, but also terrified by their harsh and eccentric training methods. He decides to become their disciple in order to become stronger and protect Miu, who he develops a crush on. However, his decision also attracts the attention of various enemies who want to challenge him or use him for their own purposes. Some of these enemies include Ragnarok, a powerful delinquent gang led by Odin; Yomi, a group of elite disciples from an evil organization called Yami; and Yami itself, which seeks to spread chaos and violence through martial arts.
